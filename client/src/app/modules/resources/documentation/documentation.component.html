<ul>
	<li>User documentation (how to use the app) should be handled by business partners (subject matter expert).</li>
	<li>Infrastructure documentation should be handled by an IT professional.</li>
	<li>Developers should create technical documentation for a fellow developer of roughly equal skills.</li>
	<li>Avoid detailed documentation&mdash;it becomes stale quickly as code change, and requires a huge effort to 
		keep up-to-date.
	</li>
	<li>Use high-level documentation such as .drawio chart with mouse-over tips.</li>
	<li>Keep track of main functionalities of each file/module/service/component, etc.</li>
</ul>
