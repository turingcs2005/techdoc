<ul>
	<li>User documentation (how to use the app) should be handled by business partners (subject matter expert).</li>
	<li>Infrastructure documentation should be handled by an IT professional. Margo can write some generic documentation on Azure.</li>
	<li>Developers should create technical documentation for a fellow developer of roughly equal skills.
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid detailed documentation&mdash;it becomes stale quickly as code change, and requires a huge effort to keep the documentation up-to-date.</li>
			<li>Prefered documentation formats: 
				<ul>
					<li>Save key project information such as owner/backup owner, Git repo, deployment history, etc. into a MongoDB database via an internal app. </li>
					<li>Markdown file for high-level project documentation</li>
					<li>Material tree component for data structure.</li>
					<li>.drawio charts for front end artifacts (modules, components, services) to keep track of their main functionalities.</li>
					<li>.drawio charts for back end tables saved by the app to document schema, primary keys and foreign keys</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
